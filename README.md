OSRS Drop Roller

This is a project I've been thinking about making for some time, so I finally decided to just start it and see where it goes.

My thought is to create a small application that will simulate rolling drops from the game "Old School Runescape".

My initial idea is to make something along the lines of a function tied to a button that will randomly roll a potential item from a pre-made drop table.

I have been thinking about having drops stored in an array and then tying those items to values which can then be rolled for with a randomizer.

I will try and update this file as I have more ideas, or as I flesh things out.
